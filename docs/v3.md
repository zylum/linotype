# Linotype v3

Linotype v3 introduces explicit slug intent: Directional vs Build.

## What changed

### Explicit slug types
Previously, slugs were undifferentiated. Now:
- **Directional slugs**: explore options, make decisions, sequence work
- **Build slugs**: implement concrete changes with proof

This separation clarifies when you're deciding vs doing.

### Clearer role boundaries
- **PDA (Product Design Authority)**: owns system coherence, frames work, validates end-to-end
- **Module Architect**: owns module correctness, designs within boundaries
- **Builder**: executes build slugs (often same person as Module Architect)
- **Reviewer**: verifies proof and coherence before completion

### Standardized review gate
All build slugs must include proof before moving to review:
- Preview URL
- Screenshot
- Test output
- Commit/diff

The `linotype.sh` script enforces this requirement.

### Enhanced documentation structure
v3 introduces:
- `docs/context/app-context.md` - High-level product snapshot
- `docs/capabilities/` - Module specs and capability registry
- Starter slugs (SLUG-001 and SLUG-002)
- Automated workflow via `linotype.sh`

### Bootstrap script
The `linotype-bootstrap.sh` script creates the complete structure:
- Core documentation files
- Workflow automation
- Templates
- Starter slugs
- Optional AI assistant integration

## Migration from v2

If you're on v2:
1. Run `linotype-bootstrap.sh` in a test directory to see the new structure
2. Add `docs/context/app-context.md` to your existing repo
3. Create `docs/capabilities/registry.yml` and module specs
4. Update `linotype.sh` to the v3 version (with start/check/review/done commands)
5. Review existing slugs and ensure build slugs have proof
6. Clarify who owns PDA vs Module Architect responsibilities

## Why these changes

v3 emerged from real usage patterns:
- Teams mixed exploration with implementation, causing confusion
- Unclear role boundaries led to bottlenecks
- Slugs moved to "done" without validation
- New team members needed clearer onboarding
- Projects needed better structure for capabilities and modules

The changes make implicit practices explicit and provide better scaffolding for teams.

## Looking ahead: v0.4 Galleys

v0.4 will introduce Galleys: PDA-owned planning artefacts that group multiple module-level slugs into a coherent product change.

Galleys solve the "flat slug list" problem by providing structure without forcing hierarchy. They enable parallel module work while preserving intent and traceability.

See [Galleys](galleys.md) for details and examples.
