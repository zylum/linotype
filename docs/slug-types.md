# Slug types

## Directional slug
Clarify options, boundaries, or sequencing before implementation. Outputs: options with trade-offs, a decision (e.g. in module decisions), follow-on build slugs. Proof: decision entry, links to follow-on slugs.

## Build slug
Implement a concrete change. Outputs: working software, updated docs, build notes with proof. Proof: preview URL, screenshot, test output, or commit/diff.

Slugs live inside a galley (e.g. `slugs/*.md`). Focus (in `_agent-rules.md`) constrains scope: loose (broad, cross-domain OK), standard (single-domain default), strict (single-domain enforced).
