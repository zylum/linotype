# Slug types

## Directional slug
Purpose: clarify options, boundaries, or sequencing before implementation.

Typical outputs:
- options with trade-offs
- a decision recorded (module decisions.md if relevant)
- follow-on build slugs created

Proof examples:
- decision entry
- links to created follow-on slugs

## Build slug
Purpose: implement a concrete change.

Typical outputs:
- working software
- updated docs reflecting reality
- build notes with proof

Proof examples:
- preview URL
- screenshot
- test output
- commit/diff

## Starter slugs

When you bootstrap Linotype, you get two starter slugs:

### SLUG-001: Bootstrap or Index
Choose one:
- `SLUG-001.bootstrap-linotype.md` - For new products (define what you're building)
- `SLUG-001.index-linotype.md` - For existing products (document what exists)

Complete exactly one of these first.

### SLUG-002: First vertical slice
`SLUG-002.first-vertical-slice.md` - Deliver the smallest end-to-end slice of real value.

This proves the shape and workflow before building more.
