# Linotype

An operating model that keeps products coherent over time.

## What it is

**Linotype** gives you a lightweight way to keep docs, code, and decisions in sync as work flows between humans and AI agents. Slugs are the smallest delegable units of work; galleys group them into one product change. Everything stays in one place and stays findable.

- **Galleys** — Temporary groupings of slugs; move through planning → (queue) → doing → review → done
- **Slugs** — Smallest delegable change: clear outcome, acceptance checks, proof before review
- **Agent contract** — `docs/ai/_agent-rules.md` and repo `AGENTS.md` (focus, optimise, roles)

Linotype doesn’t replace your method (e.g. [BMAD](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD)); it’s the structural layer that keeps outputs coherent over time.

## Why Linotype?

AI-assisted development is fast, but coherence is fragile. Without structure, docs fall behind, decisions get lost, and handoffs break down. Linotype keeps integrity across tools (Kiro, Cursor, Claude) and over time.
