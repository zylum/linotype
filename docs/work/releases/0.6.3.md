# Release 0.6.3 — Casablanca

## Summary
- Extends the Casablanca (0.6.x) release with stricter agent phases and per-slug evidence discipline
- Adds modular CLI plumbing + release helpers so every repo keeps a single changelog

## Highlights
- Added execution-phase rules (Contract → Build → Verify), slug context-pack guidance, and evidence requirements to `docs/ai/_agent-rules.md` + skeleton
- Modularised `cli/linotype` into `cli/lib/linotype/*.sh` files with `release init/note` helpers
- Introduced `docs/domain/index.md` in the primary repo (already present in skeleton) plus updates to README/quick-reference/how-to-use/structure/templates

## Galley / CLI changes
- `cli/linotype` now shells out to dedicated modules and exposes new `release init|note` subcommands
- Domain + release workflows described in docs and enforced through galley templates

## Domain updates
- Root repo now ships `docs/domain/index.md` instructions for splitting modules and logging domain deltas per galley
- Agent rules require domain docs to be updated (or explicitly skipped with reasoning) before a galley closes

## Verification
- Manual smoke: `cli/linotype release init 0.6.3 Casablanca` (no duplicate warning), `cli/linotype release note 0.6.3 "Agent phases + evidence"`
- Lint/tests expected via forthcoming CI (shellcheck, bats, domain checks)
