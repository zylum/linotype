# What is Linotype?

Linotype is an operating model for building complex products while preserving coherence over time.

## The problem

As products grow, teams face:
- Context loss when returning to old work
- Drift between docs and reality
- Unclear boundaries for delegation
- Difficulty tracking decisions over time

## The solution

Linotype provides:
- **Slugs**: smallest delegable units of work with clear boundaries
- **BMAD method**: structured approach inside each slug (Boundaries, Map, Analyse, Design, Build, Validate, Document)
- **Explicit stages**: planning → doing → review → done
- **Proof requirement**: every build slug must show working evidence before review
- **Role clarity**: PDA owns coherence, Module Architects own correctness

## Core principles

1. **Coherence over time** - The system stays understandable as it evolves
2. **Delegable work** - Slugs have clear boundaries and can be handed off
3. **Reality-driven docs** - Documentation reflects what actually exists
4. **Proof-backed completion** - No slug moves to review without evidence

## When to use Linotype

Use Linotype when:
- Your product will evolve over months/years
- Multiple people need to understand the system
- You need to delegate work safely
- Context loss is expensive

Skip Linotype for:
- Throwaway prototypes
- Solo projects with no handoff needs
- Work that doesn't require coherence tracking
